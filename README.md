#  Home Assistant Samba addon with USB media support

This is a fork of the [official Samba add-on](https://github.com/home-assistant/addons/tree/master/samba) which adds support for mounting USB media.
Since only network storage is supported by Home Assistant, this allows mounting a USB drive as network storage to use with Home Assistant.
